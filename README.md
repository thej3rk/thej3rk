Hi, Iâ€™m @thej3rk, also known as Joey Hazlett.

I write freeware applications and release them on my website https://www.haztek-software.com

For the tools that I write that I am willing to share the source for, I will do so through my respositories here on GitHub.

<!---
thej3rk/thej3rk is a special repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
